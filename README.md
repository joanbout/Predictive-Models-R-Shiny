# Predictive-Models-R-Shiny
Here we deploy an R script which contains a predictive model analysis and comparison between Random Forest Model and Support Vector Machine Model.
We also deploy a shiny app  which contains two tabs, one with a boxplot of our upload file and one with the summary, correlation table and the results of the predictive models.
